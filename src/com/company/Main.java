Create a class named GolfCourse
It should have a private property that is an array of size 18, with each index being an int value of 3, 4, or 5.
It should have a method to compare scores that takes two int parameters (hole number and number of shots)
The method should return an int of the amount over or under par the number of shots is for the hole number provided
In your main class, create an int array of size 18 and populate each index with a number from 1 to 7 to simulate a golfer playing the course.
Using your GolfCourse class, calculate the golfers score (the total number above or below par based on each holes number of shots vs the par amount for that hole)
Print out the score to the console.
